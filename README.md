### Hacksprint information

### 1. What is a Hacksprint?

Following the [70/20/10](https://www.google.com/search?q=o+que+%C3%A9+a+regra+70+20+10&rlz=1C5CHFA_enDE1036DE1036&oq=o+que+%C3%A9+a+regra+70+20+10&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIICAEQABgWGB7SAQg3ODcyajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#imgrc=0oHCIDUqPyAbqM) the event aims to reinforce collaboration and hands-on learning, providing an opportunity to accelerate learning over a two-week period.

### 2. Why two weeks?

* Start: 13/05/2024
* Final presentation: 27/05/2024
